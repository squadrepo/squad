## Source Code
The Squad project consists of:
 * A React Native client application, which can be ran locally [using the instructions below](#getting-started-with-the-app).  The source code can be found here: https://github.com/squadrepo/squad
 * A back-end system implemented and hosted in the AWS cloud.  It cannot be ran locally, but the source code for our AWS Lambda functions (which contain the vast majority of the business logic) can be found here: https://github.com/squadrepo/lambda

## Deliverable Contents
### Features Implemented
 * Student User Accounts, including: 
   * Account creation and login authentication
   * Multi-stage university email verification
   * Profile customization
   * Settings changes
 * Messaging, including: 
   * Private messages between users
   * Group message threads
   * User creation of chatrooms
   * Sharing of Event posts through messages
 * Navigation, including:
   * Tabs to filter the main feed of posts per post type
   * Buttons to create posts and access messaging
   * A slide-from-the-right tray to access account and profile settings
   * A pleasant purple aesthetic
 * Social Event Posts: 
   * Posts publicizing student-driven Social Events at a user's university, including the name, date and time, address, and description, can be created and displayed to other users
   * Users can RSVP to Social Events as a 'Yes' or a 'Maybe', with the number of interested users displayed on the posts
   * Users are added to a chatroom with other attendees upon RSVPing 'Yes'
   * Users can access a separate list of their RSVPed events to quickly refer back to them
   * Each post has a comments section
 * Food Event Posts:
   * Posts publicizing university- or community-organized events that provide free food, including the name, start and end times, address, and description, can be created and displayed to other users
   * Food Events are displayed on a map view within a specified radius of the user using their devices' location services -- or, if these services are disabled, within a radius of the user's university
   * Users can 'Thumbs Up' or 'Thumbs Down' a Food Event post based on its accuracy and appeal, with the number of these ratings displayed on the post
   * Each post has a comments section
 * Tutoring Profile Posts:
   * Posts publicizing the tutoring services of a student user, including their name, bio, hourly rate, subject specialties, classes taken, and schedule, can be created and displayed to other users
   * Users can request a scheduled tutoring session with a tutor, which the tutor can accept or reject
   * Users who take part in an accepted tutoring session can rate their tutor on a scale of 1 to 5 stars, with the average rating displayed on the tutor's profile

### Features Not Implemented
 * Social Media Sign-in
   * This feature turned out to be mutually exclusive with university email verification, a core part of our application, within the AWS service we used to handle some aspects of user authentication.
 * Gig-work Posts
   * We made the decision to cut this feature due to time restrictions early in the implementation phase.

### Known Issues
 * None!

# Getting Started with the App

## 2. Downloading Expo

### Expo on Android Devices
